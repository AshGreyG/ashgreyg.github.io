= C++

*C++* is the first programming language that I have learned for a long time and dived 
into (when I was a senior high school student, I learned *Visual Basic* at that time. 
And I also learned *Python* for a short time when I entered in University). 

= JavaScript

When I entered the Tsinghua University, I became interested in all of the human knowledge, 
so I began to consider the structure of knowledge and write some notes or posts to record 
my study process. To build my own blog, I studied the *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. 
My first blog is a very very simple website just using raw JavaScript and CDN. Later I 
used the theme #link("https://chirpy.cotes.page/")[chirpy] of Jekyll to build my blog, 
this framework is splendid, but I wanted to simplify it because I didn't need those extra 
properties. So I rewrote the *SCSS* file of chirpy. Soon I gave up this framework and turned 
to an extension of VSCode: 
#link("https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/")[Markdown Preview Enhanced], 
and used it to export the CDN-hosted HTML file, I also studied `vercel.json` to redirect 
the raw markdown files of my blog to its corresponding HTML file. Finally and now, I use the 
#link("https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/shiroa/")[shiroa] to store my notes. Typst is also 
a wonderful language!

= TypeScript

When I learned *JavaScript* for my blog, I had already heard that *TypeScript* is a superset 
of *JavaScript*. Because the first programming language I learned is *C++*, so when I began 
to learn *JavaScript*, I noticed that *JavaScript* doesn't have a *type system*. Now I am 
learning *TypeScript*, like its name, it's a good language to study the type system.
